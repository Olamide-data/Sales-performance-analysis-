### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this is the "sales_performance_dataset.xlsx" file, containing the detailed information.

### Tools Used

- Excel

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains sales transaction records with the following fields:

- Order ID
- Order Date
- Product
- Region
- Quantity
- Unit Price
- Total Sales

The dataset was reviewed and prepared to ensure accuracy and consistency before analysis.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I did the following tasks:
- Checked for missing and inconsistent values.
- Ensured numerical columns such as Quantity and Total Sales were correctly formatted.
- Standardized column names for clarity and consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the structure of the data, assess data quality, and uncover key sales patterns and it focused on answering the following business questions:

- What is the overall sales performance?
- Which products generate the highest total sales?
- Which regions contribute the most to revenue?
- How is sales distributed across products and regions?
- What insights can support better business decisions?

## Results/Findings
- The analysis showed that sales performance was uneven across the regions.
- The North region generated the highest total sales, indicating stronger market demand.
- Product B emerged as the top performing product, contributing a significant portion of total revenue.
- Some products and regions underperformed compared to others.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis,I recommend the following:
- Focus marketing and sales efforts on the top-performing products to maximize revenue.
- Investigate factors contributing to high sales in the North region and replicate successful strategies in other regions.
- Develop targeted strategies to improve performance in underperforming regions and products.
- Use regular sales performance monitoring to support data-driven decision making.

### Limitations

- The analysis was conducted using Excel Online, which limited advanced date-based analysis.
- The dataset represents a limited time period and may not capture long-term sales trends.
- External factors such as seasonality, promotions, or customer behavior were not included in the dataset.
  
 ### Outcome
This project provided insights into sales performance and strengthened my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and business insight communication using Excel.
